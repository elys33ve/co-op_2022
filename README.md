# co-op

(this repo needs to be updated and will be deleted at some point because i plan to reorganize and add fall2022 stuff to the co-op repo.
I'll go through this at some point and do that while adding more context but i haven't gotten a chance yet)


From fall 2022 co-op semester:

This should be a variety of just different scrips in C, Python, etc.
This repo will probably be used mostly for personal reference and notes since the primary git repo for all work is seperate.
